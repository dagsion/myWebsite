# Personal Website

This repository records my progress in creating my personal website. I have been working on it locally during the summer so the initial commit already has contents (So sad, I should have done this earlier so it would show all my progress qwq) This website is currently been developed along with school work. Keep in tune!

This website is created using the React framework with javascript(jsx) along with my Figma design components. I also utilized Vite to edit my website in live. 

this is a sneak peek of what it looks like:
